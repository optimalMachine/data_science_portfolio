# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio
This repository has data science & machine learning projects completed for both self learning (Datacamp, Dataquest, etc.), and professional purposes. The portfolio presented in the form of Jupyter Notebook.

### Tools:
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow, scikit-learn

## Contens

### Data Analytics & Visualization (Python)
- [Degrees Pays You Back](https://github.com/optimalMachine/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/degreesPaysYouBack.ipynb): In this Jupyter Notebook, I explore a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc. to find out which major pays the most. This project is from Datacamp.
